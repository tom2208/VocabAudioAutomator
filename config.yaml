  sentence_generation: |
    Task: {number_of_sentences} {target_language} sentences ({language_level}).
    Theme: {setting}
    Main word: "{target_word}"
    
    {optional_instruction}
    
    Rules:
    1. Vary grammatical form of the main word (tenses, cases, singular/plural).
    2. Format STRICTLY as: [Sentence in {target_language}] | [Translation in {source_language}]
    3. Place each pair on a new line.
    4. STRICT: NO filler, greetings, numbers, or bullet points.
    5. ACCURACY: The translation must use valid, natural {source_language} vocabulary. Do not invent hybrid words or mistakenly apply {target_language} grammar/suffixes to {source_language} words.
